            <li>Visit the Pre-school with your child. Observe the other children and how they order their day. Talk about how, when at Pre-school you can have drinks and snacks and make new friends.</li>
            <li>Discuss the pre-school with your child. Talk about the staff you have met and the other children who were there.</li>
            <li>Arm your child with practical information like how to hang up their coat. Dress your child comfortably in suitable clothes. Getting dirty is a big concern for young children. </li>
            <li>Practice leaving your child with a trusted friend/grandparent. Make sure the child is aware of what is happening. Short separations are a good way for your child to develop the understanding and trust that is needed to ensure they have a good time when you are not there. </li>
