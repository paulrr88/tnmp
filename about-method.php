        <h2>Admissions Policy</h2>

        <p class="centre">(Safeguarding and promoting children's welfare.p.23)</p>

        <h3 class="title">Statement of intent</h3>

        <p>We are a Charity Montessori Pre-school offering flexible quality childcare for children between the ages of 2 years and 8 years.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Prioritisation of the Montessori Method</h3>

        <p>As our Pre-school follows the Montessori Method, children whose parents are genuinely interested in the Montessori ethos and education will be accepted immediately, assuming places are available.<p>

        <h3 class="title">Pattern of Attendance</h3>

        <p>In line with the principle stated above, the following prioritisation criteria will be applied to all applicants:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Availability of spaces in our Pre-school taking into account the staff/child ratios, the age of the child and the registration requirements.</li>
          <li>Children who receive funding from WSCC need to be booked in for a minimum of four Montessori Core sessions and one Early Bird/ Lunch club or Late Owls.</li>
          <li>Children who do not receive the WSCC funding need to be booked for at least 2 Montessori Core sessions.</li>
          <li>Our Pre-school offers two children stand alone 2 year old funding spaces of thirteen hours a week for 43 weeks. Families who only want to access 2 year old funding hours each week will be considered on an individual basis taking into consideration the family’s needs and the feasible availability in our Pre-school at the time of enquiry only if they are eligible for the WSCC 2 year old funding. Please put your request in writing.</li>
          <li>Our Pre-school offers two children stand alone 3/4 year old Free Entitlement spaces of thirteen hours a week for 43 weeks. Families who only want to access 3/4 year old funding hours each week will be considered on an individual basis taking into consideration the family’s needs and the feasible availability in our Pre-school at the time of enquiry only if they are eligible for the 3/4 year old Free Entitlement. Please put your request in writing.</li>
          <li>Our Pre-school, if this is financially viable will keep a place vacant for emergency admissions.
          Terms and conditions of Admissions</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A place is reserved on receipt of an administration fee and written registration form. Our Terms and Conditions must be signed prior to your child’s entry to Pre-school. The minimum number of sessions for a child has been agreed. A terms notice is required to withdraw your child.</p>

        <a name="settling"></a>

        <h2>Settling In</h2>

        <p>We want our children to feel safe and happy in the absence of their parents, to recognise other adults as a source of authority, help and friendship and to be able to share with their parents afterwards the new learning experiences enjoyed in the pre-school.</p>

        <img src="images/nav-purple.png" />

        <p>In order to accomplish this, we will:</p>

        <ul class="body">
          <li>Arrange for the child to have <em>four</em> visits to the pre-school. These visits will take place the term before the child is due to start. The four visits will comprise of two one hour visits with an adult, two one hour visits unaccompanied.</li>
          <li>Make clear to families from the outset that they will be supported in the pre-school for as long as it takes to settle their child there.</li>
          <li>Reassure parents whose children seem to be taking a long time settling into the Pre-school.</li>
          <li>Introduce new families into the group on a staggered basis, for example two new children each day for a week rather than ten new children all at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Children cannot play or learn successfully if they are anxious and unhappy. Our settling procedures aim to help parents to help their children to feel comfortable in the pre-school, to benefit from what it has to offer, and to be confident that their parents will return at the end of the session.</p>

        <p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

        <hr />



        <a name="pay"></a>

        <h2>Payment &amp; Debtor's Policy</h2>

        <p>As you will be aware, our pre- School is a charitable non-profit making organisation and therefore do not have huge reserves of money.</p>

        <p>It is important that we are able to forecast all of our income and expenditure, and for this reason, all fees are due in advance and can normally be paid termly or half termly or weekly.</p>

        <p>This statement of intent is set out to ensure all persons involved with our Pre-School understand our payment procedures.</p>

        <p>We want all families to feel welcome and we believe that all children have the right to a high quality Montessori education.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Aims</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>To ensure your child's days are securely booked.</li>
          <li>That staff and families work and learn together to benefit the smooth attendance of their child.</li>
          <li>Provide correct charges for services used.</li>
          <li>Liaise with parents/guardians to be flexible in line with their financial situations.</li>
          <li>Support parents and provide information regarding additional help available from Government incentives.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="title">Methods</h3>

        <p>In order to achieve this, our pre-school will:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Not put into progress a Registration Form without the non-refundable Administration Fee being paid first.</li>
          <li>At induction fully inform parents/guardians of the fee and payment structure of our pre-school ensure that the Terms and Conditions have been read/understood and signed.</li>
          <li>Issue an invoice to parents prior to fees being due. The invoice will give details of the hours and sessions due to be paid.</li>
          <li>If a payment plan has been agreed between a family and our pre-school, we reserve the right to withdraw that facility if the agreed payments are not being made.</li>
          <li>If for any reason a parent/career expects to be unable to make payments, please discuss this immediately with our School Manager/Senior Classroom Manager or Fees administrator. Not our classroom staff.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the event of a family not honouring our terms and conditions and not providing payment for services given the following procedures will apply.</p>

        <img src="images/payments.png" alt="Fees due; 7 days later overdue account reminder will be issued; 7 days later first warning letter will be issued; 7 days later second warning letter will be issued with a £10 administration charge; 7 days later debt will be discussed at Management Committee Meeting, third warning letter will be issued with a £10 administration charge; 7 days later debt to be handed over to a debt collection agency who will add 12% to your outstanding debt." />

        <p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Failure to pay the debt collection agency may harm your credit rating and affect your ability to borrow money, including mortgages and credit cards, in the future. We therefore only pursue this option as a last resort and would ask you to talk to us first if you have any difficulty in paying your child's fees.</em></p>

        <hr />



        <a name="pay"></a>

        <h2>Equal Opportunities</h2>

        <p>The pre-school believes that its activities should be open to all children and families, and to all adults committed to their welfare. We aim to ensure that all who wish to work in, or volunteer to help with, our pre-school have an equal chance to do so.</p>

        <p>The pre-school is open to every family in the community and any family joining will be made aware of our policy on equal opportunities.</p>

        <img src="images/nav-purple.png" />

        <p><strong>Employment</strong>: The pre-school will appoint the best person for each job and will treat fairly all applications for jobs and all those appointed.</p>

        <p><strong>Families</strong>: The pre-school recognises that many different types of family successfully love and care for their children.</p>

        <p><strong>Festivals</strong>: Our aim is to show respectful awareness of all major events in the lives of the children and families in the pre-school, and in our society as a whole, and to welcome the diversity of backgrounds from which they come.</p>

          <p>In order to achieve this, without indoctrination in any faith, children will be encouraged to welcome a range of different festivals, together with stories, celebrations and certain food and clothing they involve, as part of the diversity of life.</p>

        <p><strong>Activities</strong>: All children will be respected and their individuality and potential recognised, valued and nurtured. Activities and the use of equipment will offer children opportunities to develop in an environment free from prejudice and discrimination.</p>

        <p>Appropriate opportunities will be given to children to explore, acknowledge and value similarities and differences between themselves and others.</p>

        <p><strong>Resources</strong>: Resources will be chosen to give children a balanced view of the world and an appreciation of the rich diversity of our multi-racial society.</p>

        <p>Materials will be selected to help children to develop their self-respect and to respect other people by avoiding stereotypes and derogatory pictures and messages about any group of people.</p>

        <p><strong>Special needs</strong>: The pre-school recognises the wide range of special needs of children and families in the community, and will consider what part it can play in meeting these needs.</p>

        <p><strong>Discriminatory behaviour and remarks</strong>: These are unacceptable in the pre-school. The response will aim to be sensitive to the feelings of the victim(s) and to help those responsible to understand and overcome their prejudices.</p>

        <p><strong>Food</strong>: Medical, cultural and dietary needs will be met.</p>
