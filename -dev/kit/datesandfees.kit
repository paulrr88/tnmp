        <p><strong>West Sussex County Council (WSCC) will fund up to fifteen hours per week</strong> for children over three years of age as part of the government's Free Entitlement scheme, but we charge you directly for the additional cost of the Montessori education. <a href="<!--$dir-->about/policies/">Our policies</a> do permit parents to take just the free entitlement if sufficient spaces are available, but prioritises those who want the Montessori education. However, WSCC funds a maximum of 38 weeks of the year, whereas we open for 43 including half-term holidays. Any sessions over and above those funded by WSCC must be paid for in full by you.</p>

        <p>To apply for your Free Entitlement you must complete an application to the West Sussex Early Years Partnership, available from us, and show us your child's birth certificate as proof of age.
