        <h2>Staff</h2>

        <p>The day-to-day running of the school is carried out by the Principal and the School Manager, both of whom hold Montessori Diplomas. Responsible to them is one Classroom manager and their teams of dedicated teaching assistants who direct the children through the Early Years curriculum firmly based on Montessori principles. For educational sessions we maintain a staff:child ratio of 1:6 for 3/4 year olds and 1:3 for 2 year olds. This meets the OFSTED and government requirements. </p>

        <h2>Management Committee</h2>

        <p>The New Montessori Pre-school is a limited company run by a Management Committee comprising a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Secretary and additional members. The Committee is made up of non-remunerated volunteers; parents and local professional people who work together with the Pre-school to ensure the best for our children. The Committee meets every 6-8 weeks to discuss various matters relating to the running of the school and to make important decisions with regard to the school’s future. Every July the Management Committee meet to agree the fee raise for the September. We are always looking for additional members so if you think you may be able to help please <a href="<!--$dir-->">contact us</a>.</p>

        <p>The Principal and School Manager attend every meeting and as a parent you are welcome to attend Management Committee meetings at any time. You can only be involved in the decision making process if you are a Committee Member. Details of meetings are posted on the school doors and notified in Newsletters. Copies of the Annual General Meetings and the minutes of the meeting are available from your Classroom Manager.</p>

        <h2>Fundraising Team</h2>

        <p>The Montessori way of teaching is a unique method that requires very specific and expensive equipment, but we aim to help keep the school’s fees at an affordable rate. The Pre-school is a non-profit making organisation (with charity status) and raises funds through events arranged by the Fundraising Team. This enables the school to purchase additional Montessori equipment without charging enhanced fees.</p>

        <p>The Fundraising Team meets every 6-8 weeks, dependent on the events that need to be discussed and arranged. There is always a member of staff at the meetings, so you also get to meet your child’s teachers informally. New parents are always needed as we are constantly brainstorming for new fundraising ideas!</p>

        <p>Details of the next meetings arranged for both the Committee and the Fundraising Team will be displayed on our notice board, as well as being highlighted in our newsletters.</p>

        <p>The Fundraising Team organises:</p>

        <ul class="lesspadding">
          <li>Tubes of Bubbles: Tubes are given out to the children; the children then fill the tube with coins and return to the Pre-school near to Easter.</li>
          <li>Sponsored wheels: Held in Victoria Park in May/June</li>
          <li>Teddy bear’s picnic: Held in Victoria Park in June/July</li>
          <li>An Annual Raffle: Held at our Pre-schools Annual General Meeting in October/November</li>
          <li>Christmas gifts: Cards made by your child, calendars of your child, letters to Santa, Handprint Bags</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All these activities enable the Fundraising Team to provide extra curriculum events for the children at the end of each term, as well as contributing towards the costs of the Montessori Materials.</p>

        <p>The fundraising team also publish our occasional magazine Monti's News which aims to keep parents in touch with what's happening at the school, and contains articles of general interest on the Montessori method written by the school staff. If you have a business or service that you would like to advertise in Monti's News please <a href="">contact us via our contacts page</a>.</p>
