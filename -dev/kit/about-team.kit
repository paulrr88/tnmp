        <h2>Staff</h2>

        <p>The day-to-day running of the school is carried out by the Principal and the School Manager, both of whom hold Montessori Diplomas. Responsible to them is one Classroom manager and their teams of dedicated teaching assistants who direct the children through the Early Years curriculum firmly based on Montessori principles. For educational sessions we maintain a staff:child ratio of 1:6 for 3/4 year olds and 1:3 for 2 year olds. This meets the Ofsted and government requirements. </p>

        <h2>Fundraising Team</h2>

        <p>Our fundraising team is vital because it provides extra income, allowing us to buy specialised Montessori equipment for the classroom as well as other play equipment for the children. Made up of parents from the school the team does a tremendous job, organising all sorts of events where parents and children can enjoy themselves while raising money for us. Nonetheless they always welcome fresh ideas so if you can help please ask at the school.</p>

        <p>The fundraising team also publish our occasional magazine Monti's News which aims to keep parents in touch with what's happening at the school, and contains articles of general interest on the Montessori method written by the school staff. If you have a business or service that you would like to advertise in Monti's News please <a href="">contact us via our contacts page</a>.</p>
