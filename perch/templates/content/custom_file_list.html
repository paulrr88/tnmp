      <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

      <p>This item displays a number of links in a list that lead to files, basically to anything you want the user to be able to download, like PDF or Word documents for instance.</p>

      <p>You can either:<br />
        <span style="padding-left: 20px">- <strong>Edit an existing file</strong> by changing the fields that are currently on this page</span><br />
        <span style="padding-left: 20px">- <strong>Add a new file</strong> to the list by scrolling to the bottom of this page and clicking "Save &amp; Add another", which will result in a new blank set of fields appearing at the bottom of this page that can then be filled in as below with appropriate text and a link to a file. See below for instructions!</span>

      <p>There's one section for each file in the list, and in each section you'll find a number of fields where you can enter information. Below are instructions for each:</p>

      <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        - <strong>"Text to display in link to file" field:</strong> this is what the link will say, for instance "OFSTED report document", which would then output a link saying just that, which the user can then click to be taken to the download in question.

        <br />

        - <strong>"Download type" field:</strong> this is the file type in question which is displayed after the link to tell the user what it is that they are downloading. For instance, PDF or Word Document.

        <br />

        - <strong>"File" field:</strong> this area is where you can select your file. To do this you will need to:<br />
        <span style="padding-left: 20px">- Click "Select or upload a file"<br />
        <span style="padding-left: 20px">- In the resulting Select an Asset area that pops up, either:<br />
          <span style="padding-left: 40px"> - Click an existing item that you want to link to and then click "Use Selected", or<br />
          <span style="padding-left: 40px"> - Click the "+Add Asset" button in the top right, and then either drop a file into the indicated box area or click the box area to select the file from your computer.<br />
          <span style="padding-left: 60px">- Click the file that you just added, now in a little box in the "Select an Asset" area<br />
          <span style="padding-left: 60px">- Click "Use Selected" in the top right of the "Select an Asset" section ("Use Selected" should be highlighted green if you've correctly clicked a file to be used, if not just try clicking again or "Use Selected" won't do anything)<br />

        <span style="padding-left: 20px">- <strong>N.B. if you enter this area by accident and want to go back</strong>, click the grey (X) icon in the far top right of the screen.<br />
        <span style="padding-left: 20px">- PDF format for documents is preferable if you can manage it as more people can read this format than items created in Word etc!
      </p>

      <p><strong>To delete an item:</strong> click the little red "Delete" button to the top right of one of the sections below and then click "YES" in the little box that pops up over your mouse cursor.</p>
      <p><strong>If you just want to delete a file but keep the title etc:</strong> click the little check box next to the red Remove text in the File box.</p>
