        <p>Welcome to the St Andrew's Church, Ferring, website, we hope that this site will be of interest to you.</p>

        <p>If you live or are visiting the area of Ferring, you will find a very warm welcome at our church. We are a friendly village
        church on the sunny South Coast. It's a bit of a squeeze on a Sunday morning, but there is room for you.</p>

        <p>Try the 9:30 on Sundays for the Parish Communion.</p>

        <p>On the first Sunday of each month there is a Family Service in the Church at 9:30, in place of the Parish Communion.
        Our Uniformed Organisations attend this service.</p>

        <p>Seasonal Services will be shown on the Weekly Pew sheets, on the Notice boards, in the Parish Magazine, and on this website.</p>

        <p>See the <a href="services">Services page</a> for details of all services, and notification of any changes.</p>
